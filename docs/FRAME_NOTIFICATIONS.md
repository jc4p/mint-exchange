# Sending Notifications

:::tip
Reference: 
[Notifications Spec](/docs/specification#notifications)
:::

Mini Apps can send notifications to users who have added the Mini App to
their Farcaster client and enabled notifications.

## Overview

At a high-level notifications work like so:
- when a user enables notifications for your app, their Farcaster client (i.e. Warpcast)
will generate a unique notification token and send it to your server
- to send a notification to a user, make a request to the Farcaster client's servers with the
notification token and content
- if a user later disables notifications, you'll receive another event indicating
the user is unsubscribed and the notification token is no longer valid

## Terms
To make our life easier, let's call:
- **Farcaster Client**: An application like Warpcast that is able to display Mini Apps.
- **Notification Server**: Your server (see bellow).
- **(Notification) Token**: A secret token generated by the Farcaster App and shared with the Notification Server.
A token is unique for each (Farcaster Client, Mini App, user Fid) tupple.

A notification token is basically a permission that a Farcaster client gives your app (on behalf of a user)
to send them notifications.

## Steps 

::::steps
### Listen for events 

You'll need a notification server to receive webhook events and a database to store
notification tokens for users:
- **Managed** - If you'd rather stay focused on your app, use
[Neynar](https://neynar.com) to manage notification tokens on your behalf. Includes ways to target notifications and send without writing code: <br />
[Setup a managed notifications server with
Neynar](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/send-notifications-to-mini-app-users).
- **Roll your own** - If you want to host your own server to receive webhooks:<br />
[Follow the Receiving Webhooks guide](#receiving-webhooks).


### Add your webhook URL in `farcaster.json`

If you haven't already, follow the [Publishing your app](/docs/guides/publishing) guide to host a
`farcaster.json` on your app's domain.

Define the `webhookUrl` property in your app's configuration in `farcaster.json`: 

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjU0NDgsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHg2MWQwMEFENzYwNjhGOEQ0NzQwYzM1OEM4QzAzYUFFYjUxMGI1OTBEIn0",
    "payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiJleGFtcGxlLmNvbSJ9",
    "signature": "MHg3NmRkOWVlMjE4OGEyMjliNzExZjUzOTkxYTc1NmEzMGZjNTA3NmE5OTU5OWJmOWFmYjYyMzAyZWQxMWQ2MWFmNTExYzlhYWVjNjQ3OWMzODcyMTI5MzA2YmJhYjdhMTE0MmRhMjA4MmNjNTM5MTJiY2MyMDRhMWFjZTY2NjE5OTFj"
  },
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Example App",
    "iconUrl": "https://example.com/icon.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://example.com",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.png",
    "buttonTitle": "Check this out",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://example.com/splash.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#eeccff",
    "webhookUrl": "https://example.com/api/webhook" // [!code focus] 
  }
}
```

### Get users to add your app

For a Mini App to send notifications, it needs to first be added by a user to
their Farcaster client and for notifications to be enabled (these will be
enabled by default). 

Use the [addMiniApp](/docs/sdk/actions/add-frame) action while a user is using your app to prompt
them to add it:


### Save the notification tokens

When notifications are enabled, the Farcaster client generates a unique
notification token for the user. This token is sent to `webhookUrl` defined in your `farcaster.json`
along with a `url` that the app should call to send a notification. 

The `token` and `url` need to be securely saved to database so they can be
looked up when you want to send a notification to a particular user.


### Send a notification

![notifications schematic](/notification_schematic.png)

Once you have a notification token for a user, you can send them a notification
by sending a `POST` request the `url` associated with that token.

:::tip
If your are sending the same notification to multiple users, you batch up to a
100 sends in a single request by providing multiple `tokens`. You can safely
use the same `notificationId` for all batches.
:::

The body of that request must match the following JSON schema:

import SendNotificationRequestSchema from '../../../snippets/sendNotificationRequestSchema.mdx'

<SendNotificationRequestSchema />

The server should response with an HTTP 200 OK and the following JSON body:

import SendNotificationResponseSchema from '../../../snippets/sendNotificationResponseSchema.mdx'

<SendNotificationResponseSchema />

<br />

When a user clicks the notification, the Farcaster client will:

- Open your Mini App at `targetUrl`
- Set the `context.location` to a `FrameLocationNotificationContext`

```ts
export type FrameLocationNotificationContext = {
  type: 'notification';
  notification: {
    notificationId: string;
    title: string;
    body: string;
  };
};
```

[Example code to send a
notification](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/7905a24b7cd254a77a7e1a541288379b444bc23e/src/app/api/send-notification/route.ts#L25-L65)


#### Avoid duplicate notifications

To avoid duplicate notifications, specify a stable `notificationId` for each
notification you send. This identifier is joined with the FID (e.g. `(fid,
notificationId)` to create a unique key that is used to deduplicate requests 
to send a notification over a 24 hour period.

For example, if you want to send a daily notification to users you could use
`daily-reminder-05-06-2024` as your `notificationId`. Now you can safely retry
requests to send the daily reminder notifications within a 24 hour period.

#### Rate Limits

Host servers may impose rate limits per `token`. The standard rate limits,
which are enforced by Warpcast, are:

- 1 notification per 30 seconds per `token`
- 100 notifications per day per `token`

::::


## Receiving webhooks

Users can add and configure notification settings Mini Apps within their
Farcaster client. When this happens Farcaster clients will send events your
server that include data relevant to the event.

This allows your app to:
- keep track of what users have added or removed your app
- securely receive tokens that can be used to send notifications to your users

:::note
If you'd rather stay focused on your app, [Neynar](https://neynar.com) offers a
[managed service to handle
webhooks](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/send-notifications-to-frame-users#step-1-add-events-webhook-url-to-frame-manifest)
on behalf of your application.

### Events

#### frame_added

Sent when the user adds the Mini App to their Farcaster client (whether or not
this was triggered by an `addMiniApp()` prompt).

The optional `notificationDetails` object provides the `token` and `url` if the
client equates adding to enabling notifications (Warpcast does this).

##### Payload

```json
{
  "event": "frame_added",
  "notificationDetails": {
    "url": "https://api.farcaster.xyz/v1/frame-notifications",
    "token": "a05059ef2415c67b08ecceb539201cbc6"
  }
}
```

#### frame_removed

Sent when a user removes a mini app, which means that any notification tokens for
that fid and client app (based on signer requester) should be considered
invalid:

##### Payload

```json
{
  "event": "frame_removed"
}
```

#### notifications_disabled

Sent when a user disables notifications from e.g. a settings panel in the
client app. Any notification tokens for that fid and client app (based on
signer requester) should be considered invalid:

##### Payload

```json
{
  "event": "notifications_disabled"
}
```

#### notifications_enabled

Sent when a user enables notifications (e.g. after disabling them). The payload
includes a new `token` and `url`:

##### Payload

```json
{
  "event": "notifications_enabled",
  "notificationDetails": {
    "url": "https://api.farcaster.xyz/v1/frame-notifications",
    "token": "a05059ef2415c67b08ecceb539201cbc6"
  }
}
```

### Handling events

Farcaster clients will POST events to the `webhookUrl` specified in your `farcaster.json`.

Your endpoint should:
- verify the event
- persist relevant data
- return a 200 response

If your app doesn't respond with a 200, the Farcaster client will attempt to
re-send the event. The exact number of retries is up to each client.

### Verifying events

Events are signed by the app key of a user with a [JSON Farcaster
Signature](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/208). This allows
Mini Apps to verify the Farcaster client that generated the notification and the 
Farcaster user they generated it for. 

The
[`@farcaster/frame-node`](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames/tree/main/packages/frame-node)
library provides a helper for verifying events. To use it, you'll need to supply a validation
function that can check the signatures against the latest Farcaster network state.

An implementation that uses [Neynar](https://neynar.com) is provided. You can sign up and get
an API key on their free tier. Make sure to set `NEYNAR_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Example

```ts twoslash
const requestJson = "base64encodeddata";

// ---cut---
import {
  ParseWebhookEvent,
  parseWebhookEvent,
  verifyAppKeyWithNeynar,
} from "@farcaster/frame-node";

try {
  const data = await parseWebhookEvent(requestJson, verifyAppKeyWithNeynar);
} catch (e: unknown) {
  const error = e as ParseWebhookEvent.ErrorType;

  switch (error.name) {
    case "VerifyJsonFarcasterSignature.InvalidDataError":
    case "VerifyJsonFarcasterSignature.InvalidEventDataError":
      // The request data is invalid
    case "VerifyJsonFarcasterSignature.InvalidAppKeyError":
      // The app key is invalid
    case "VerifyJsonFarcasterSignature.VerifyAppKeyError":
      // Internal error verifying the app key (caller may want to try again)
  }
}
```
